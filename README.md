Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1.Unit Testing-Tests individual components or functions of the software in isolation.
               Usually performed by developers using frameworks like JUnit (Java), PyTest (Python), or Mocha (JavaScript).
Importance:Ensures each unit (function, method, or module) works correctly.
            Detects bugs early in development, reducing the cost of fixing defects later.
            Improves code maintainability and allows for safe refactoring.
2. Integration Testing-Tests how different components or modules interact with each other.
         Ensures proper data flow between integrated units.egAPI testing, database integration, and microservices communication testing.
 Importance:Identifies errors in interactions between modules that work fine independently.
            Ensures that combined components function as expected.
            Helps catch defects related to data inconsistency, broken connections, or incorrect API responses.
3. System Testing-Tests the entire system as a whole to ensure that it meets specified requirements.
                  Conducted in an environment similar to production.
                   Covers functional and non-functional aspects, such as performance, security, and usability.
Importance:Ensures that the complete software system works correctly under different conditions.
           Helps detect defects in end-to-end processes.
           Validates that the software meets both business and technical requirements before deployment.
4. Acceptance Testing-Determines whether the software is ready for release by checking if it meets user and business requirements.
                     Performed by end-users or clients in a real-world scenario.
                     Includes User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and Beta Testing.
Importance:Ensures the software meets customer expectations before final deployment.
           Identifies usability issues and real-world problems that developers may have overlooked.
           Acts as the final validation step before the software goes live.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
